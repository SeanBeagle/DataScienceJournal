Data validation is an essential part of any data handling task whether you’re in the field collecting information, analyzing data, or preparing to present your data to stakeholders. If your data isn’t accurate from the start, your results definitely won’t be accurate either. That’s why it’s necessary to verify and validate your data before it is used.

While data validation is a critical step in any data workflow, it’s often skipped over. It may seem as if data validation is a step that slows down your pace of work, however, it is essential because it will help you create the best results possible. These days data validation can be a much quicker process than you might’ve thought. With data integration platforms that can incorporate and automate validation processes, validation can be treated as an essential ingredient to your workflow rather than an additional step.
